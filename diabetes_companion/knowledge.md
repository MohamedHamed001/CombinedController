### About Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the pancreas produces very little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Without insulin, blood glucose (sugar) levels become too high, which over time harms the body.

Diet and physical activity are critically important in managing the ABCs (A1C, Blood pressure, and Cholesterol) of type 1 diabetes. Balancing food, exercise, and insulin is key to achieving glycemic targets.

### Nutritional Guidelines for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)

- **Energy intake** is based on ideal body weight to prevent overweight/obesity.
- **Macronutrient distribution**:
  - Carbohydrates: 50–55% (min ~130 g/day)
  - Protein: 15–20%
  - Fat: 25–30%
  - Fiber: 20–30 g/day
- **Supplements** only if deficiency exists.

---

### Carbohydrates

- Greatest impact on blood glucose.
- Carbohydrate Counting (CC) helps dosing insulin accurately.
- Avoid sugary drinks, prefer water.
- Non-nutritive sweeteners acceptable within limits.

---

### Protein

- 15–20% of total energy if kidneys are healthy.
- Increase during dialysis.
- High-protein meals cause delayed glucose rises; insulin adjustments may be needed.
- Choose lean meats and plant-based sources.

---

### Fat

- Limit to 25–30% of total energy; <10% from saturated fats.
- Emphasize unsaturated fats.
- Poor-quality fats worsen glucose control and increase cardiovascular risk.

---

### Fiber

- Recommended: 20–30 g/day.
- Improves glycemic control and cardiovascular health.

---

### Dietary Adherence

- Commonly poor among T1D patients.
- Barriers: complex regimens, low awareness, lifestyle, limited support.
- Dietitian consultation improves outcomes.
- Culturally sensitive education is key.

---

### Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL)

- **GI**: impact of food on glucose rise.
- **GL**: GI + carb amount.
- Low GI/GL may help reduce HbA1c.
- Effects vary per individual.

---

### Insulin Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes

- **Basal Insulin**: Long/intermediate-acting; controls glucose between meals.
- **Bolus Insulin**: Rapid/short-acting; taken before meals.

**Preferred Methods**:
- Basal-bolus injections
- CSII (Insulin Pump Therapy)

---

### Basal Insulin

- Types: detemir, glargine, degludec, NPH.
- Long-acting reduces nocturnal hypoglycemia.
- Some allow flexible dosing.
- Biosimilars are effective alternatives.

---

### Bolus Insulin

- Types: aspart, lispro, glulisine.
- Take 0–15 minutes before meals (30–45 min for regular insulin).
- Helps post-meal glucose and reduces hypoglycemia.

---

### Hypoglycemia & Insulin Therapy

- Most common insulin side effect.
- Caused by skipped meals, too much insulin, or increased activity.
- Prevention:
  - Frequent monitoring
  - Bedtime snacks for those on NPH
  - Adjustments around exercise

---

### Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)

- Useful if basal-bolus therapy isn’t sufficient.
- Benefits:
  - Modest A1C improvement
  - Reduced hypoglycemia risk
- Requires educated, motivated patient and expert team.

---

### Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)

- Gives real-time glucose data.
- Reduces A1C by 0.2–0.6%.
- More effective with frequent use and high baseline A1C.
- Reduces severe hypoglycemia risk, esp. in unaware patients.

---

### Adjunctive Therapies

- **Metformin**: may reduce insulin need and help weight, no lasting A1C effect.
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: lower glucose but risk DKA; not approved for T1D.
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: reduce insulin dose/weight; A1C benefit inconsistent.

---

### Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

**Causes**:
- Excess insulin
- Skipped meals
- Physical activity
- Medications (aspirin, steroids)
- Medical conditions (tumors, hepatitis)
- Alcohol binge

**Symptoms**:
- Hunger, sweating, confusion, fast heartbeat, shaking

**Prevention**:
- Eat regular meals/snacks
- Monitor BG
- Use glucose tabs as needed

---

### Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)

**Causes**:
- Inadequate insulin
- Illness, stress
- Poor adherence
- Medical conditions
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Symptoms**:
- Thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurry vision

**Prevention**:
- Follow insulin plan
- Monitor BG
- Exercise regularly

---

### Insulin Dose Calculations

#### Total Daily Insulin Requirement (TDD)
- **Formula**:
  - `TDD = Weight (lbs) ÷ 4`  
  - or `TDD = Weight (kg) × 0.55`
- **Example**:
  - 160 lbs → 160 ÷ 4 = **40 units/day**
  - 72.7 kg → 72.7 × 0.55 = **40 units/day**

---

#### Basal-Bolus Distribution
- 40% basal, 60% bolus
- **Example**:
  - TDD = 40 → Basal = **16 units**, Bolus = **24 units**
  - Bolus across 3 meals → 24 ÷ 3 = **8 units per meal**

---

#### Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF)
- **Purpose**: how much 1 unit of insulin lowers BG
- **Formula**:
  - Rapid insulin: `1500 ÷ TDD`
  - Regular insulin: `1800 ÷ TDD`
- **Example**:
  - TDD = 40 → ISF = 37.5
  - Correction for BG 160 → (160 - 90) ÷ 37.5 = **1.9 units**

---

#### Carbohydrate-to-Insulin Ratio (C:I)
- **Formula**: `500 ÷ TDD`
- **Example**:
  - TDD = 40 → Ratio = 12.5
  - 90g carbs → 90 ÷ 12.5 = **7.2 units**
- **Adjustments**:
  - If BG consistently high: **decrease** ratio by 10–20%
  - If BG consistently low: **increase** ratio by 10–20%

## Insulin Pump: Function, Use & Tips

### What is an Insulin Pump?
An insulin pump is a small electronic device that delivers insulin throughout the day to help manage blood glucose levels. It delivers:
- **Basal insulin** – a steady amount of insulin to control blood sugar between meals and overnight.
- **Bolus insulin** – additional insulin taken at mealtimes or to correct high blood sugar.

### How It Works
- A thin tube (cannula) is inserted under the skin and connected to the pump via tubing or patch-style.
- You program doses based on blood glucose and food intake.

### Benefits
- More precise insulin dosing
- Greater flexibility in lifestyle and meal timing
- Fewer injections
- Easier handling of dawn phenomenon or variable schedules

### Risks
- Infusion site infections
- Risk of DKA if insulin delivery is interrupted
- Cost and learning curve

### Tips
- Change infusion site every 2–3 days
- Monitor for blockages or site irritation
- Keep backup insulin pens available

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): Function, Use & Tips

### What is a CGM?
A CGM is a wearable sensor that continuously tracks glucose levels in real-time or through scanning.

### How It Works
- Inserted under the skin and lasts 7–14 days
- Transmits data to your smartphone, insulin pump, or a separate receiver
- Shows **trends**, **alerts**, and **glucose variability**

### Benefits
- Less finger-pricking
- Early warnings for highs/lows
- Improves time-in-range
- Trend arrows help proactive decisions

### Tips
- Ensure proper calibration if needed
- Review trends, not just numbers
- Use alarms wisely to avoid alert fatigue

### Sick Day Rules

When you're sick, your blood glucose levels can become unpredictable—even if you're not eating.

**Guidelines:**

- **Never stop insulin.** Your body needs insulin even if you’re not eating.
- **Check blood glucose** every 2–4 hours.
- **Check ketones** if BG > 240 mg/dL or if you feel nauseated or ill.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drink 8 oz (240 ml) of fluids every hour.
- **Eat small meals** or carb-containing fluids if unable to eat solids.
- **Adjust insulin doses** as needed. You may require more insulin than usual.
- **Call your healthcare provider if:**
  - Vomiting > once
  - Moderate to large ketones
  - BG > 300 mg/dL for more than 6 hours
  - You have signs of DKA (e.g., fruity breath, confusion, rapid breathing)


### Exercise and Physical Activity

**Benefits:**
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Helps maintain a healthy weight
- Reduces cardiovascular risks

**Precautions:**
- Check BG before, during, and after exercise
- Avoid exercise if ketones are present
- Eat a carb snack if BG < 100 mg/dL
- Reduce insulin or increase carb intake for long-duration exercise

**Tips:**
- Carry glucose tablets or juice during activity
- Use CGM/FGM to monitor glucose trends
- Inform gym partner or coach about your condition


### Mental Health and Coping

Living with T1D can be mentally exhausting. It's normal to experience burnout, anxiety, or depression.

**Strategies:**
- Join a diabetes support group (online or in-person)
- Practice stress reduction: meditation, journaling, deep breathing
- Speak with a mental health professional if overwhelmed
- Create a self-care routine: sleep, nutrition, downtime
- Talk openly with loved ones about your needs


### Alcohol and Diabetes

Alcohol can cause low blood sugar several hours after drinking.

**Guidelines:**
- Always eat when drinking
- Avoid drinking on an empty stomach
- Monitor BG frequently for up to 24 hours after
- Wear diabetes ID
- Limit to 1 drink/day (women), 2 drinks/day (men)

**Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be mistaken for drunkenness. Be cautious.**


### Driving with Type 1 Diabetes

**Before driving:**
- Check your BG. Avoid driving if < 90 mg/dL.
- Always carry a fast-acting carb (e.g., glucose tabs, juice).

**During long trips:**
- Recheck BG every 2 hours.
- Stop and treat low BG immediately.

**You should not drive until BG > 90 mg/dL and symptoms resolve.**


### Diabetes Technology Tools

**Helpful technologies include:**
- **CGM** (e.g., Dexcom, Libre): Real-time or continuous glucose monitoring.
- **Insulin pumps (CSII):** Provide precise, programmable insulin delivery.
- **Smart pens:** Track insulin doses and timing.
- **Mobile apps:** Track carbs, insulin, activity, and patterns.

**Technology helps reduce glucose variability and hypoglycemia.**


### Pregnancy and T1D

Pregnancy requires tight BG control to prevent complications.

**Before conception:**
- Aim for A1C < 6.5%
- Use CGM if possible
- Avoid medications not safe in pregnancy (e.g., statins, ACE inhibitors)

**During pregnancy:**
- Insulin needs increase, especially in 2nd/3rd trimesters
- Frequent monitoring and insulin adjustments needed

**Work with an endocrinologist and obstetrician experienced in high-risk pregnancies.**


### Emergency Situations

**Severe Hypoglycemia:**
- Signs: unconsciousness, seizure, unable to swallow
- Treat with glucagon injection or nasal spray
- Call emergency services

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):**
- Signs: nausea, vomiting, deep breathing, fruity breath, confusion
- Caused by insulin omission or infection
- Check ketones; if positive and BG > 250 mg/dL, seek immediate medical attention
